# RandomUsers
The project where I experimented with SwiftUI and "randomuser.me" API. The application displays a list of random users generated by the "randomuser.me" API. Created while completing the Codecademy iOS Developer Career Path (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer)

The project was created in 2022, and the refactoring was in 2023.

I will be very grateful if you tell me about errors in the project or suggest improvements.
